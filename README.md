# concentration

var Contributors =  ‘Jennifer Chinzi’ && ‘Paul O’Brien’ && ‘Robert Rizo’ && ‘Colleen Sexton’

Summary:

We want to create a game of concentration.
An intro page will allow the user to customize elements of the game.
The game itself will display a set number of cards that will reveal their faces when clicked (2 per round).  If images match, those two cards will be eliminated from the game.  The game is over when all cards are matched.
The final page will display scores (time it took from initial click to finish the game).  The final page will also include an ‘About Me’ segment with brief bios of all team members

What Problem or Pain Point does it solve?

This site will solve the problem of boredom in the time of pandemics!  It will also provide a chance for users to improve their skills at this game by displaying past performance metrics.
